      KGF: Chapter 2 is a 2022 Indian Kannada-language period action film[20]
      written and directed by Prashanth Neel, and produced by Vijay Kiragandur
      under his Hombale Films banner. It serves as the direct sequel to KGF:
      Chapter 1 (2018), as well as the second installment in the KGF franchise.
      The film stars an ensemble cast of Yash, Sanjay Dutt, Raveena Tandon,
      Srinidhi Shetty, Prakash Raj, Achyuth Kumar, Rao Ramesh, Vasishta N.
      Simha, Ayyappa P. Sharma, Archana Jois, Saran Shakti, Easwari Rao, John
      Kokken, T. S. Nagabharana and Malavika Avinash. Produced on a budget of
      ₹100 crore, KGF: Chapter 2 was at the time of release the most expensive
      Kannada film ever made. Neel retained the technicians from its predecessor
      with Bhuvan Gowda handling the cinematography and Ravi Basrur composed the
      film score and songs. Dutt and Tandon joined the cast in early 2019,
      marking the former's Kannada film debut. Portions of the film were shot
      simultaneously with Chapter 1. Principal photography for the rest of the
      sequences commenced in March 2019, but was halted in March 2020 owing to
      the COVID-19 lockdown in India. Filming resumed five months later in
      August 2020 and was completed in December 2020. Locations included
      Bangalore, Hyderabad, Mysore and Kolar. KGF: Chapter 2 was theatrically
      released in India on 14 April 2022 in Kannada, along with dubbed versions
      in Telugu, Tamil, Malayalam and Hindi languages. It is also the first
      Kannada film to release in IMAX. The film received critical acclaim for
      its acting, action sequences, direction, and story and emotional weight
      and became one of the greatest and most popular films from Kannada Cinema.
      It recorded the fourth highest-opening day in India, set domestic opening
      day records in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, Hindi and Malayalam, and surpassed
      the lifetime gross of its predecessor in two days to become the
      highest-grossing Kannada film. With earnings of ₹1,190−1,250 crore
      globally,[21] KGF: Chapter 2 is the second highest grossing Indian film of
      2022 worldwide, highest grossing film of 2022 in India, sixth
      highest-grossing Indian film worldwide, and the third highest-grossing
      film in India.
